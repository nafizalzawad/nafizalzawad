## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a highly motivated Computer Science student (graduating in 7 months) actively seeking a career in Software Quality Assurance. My passion lies in finding elegant solutions to complex problems and ensuring system resilience before deployment.

My experience demonstrates a strong foundation in systematic analysis and functional validation:

Systems Architect & Validator: Worked in a Blockchain-based Medical Management System as Team Leader. This involves rigorous planning and testing of data integrity, security protocols, and system throughput—core SQA domains.

Real-time Performance Testing: Developed TrafficMind, a real-time vehicle management system using Flask + Socket.IO. This project honed my skills in performance optimization and identifying latency issues under load.

UX/UI Focus on Precision: Engineered a high-fidelity, dual-theme web platform (like the Luxora project) where the final focus was on micro-interaction validation, CLS score optimization, and cross-browser consistency—all critical for high-quality user experience.

Structured Analysis: Experienced in generating comprehensive architectural documentation, including DFDs, ERDs, and Activity Diagrams, proving an ability to map complex flows and identify critical test cases early in the SDLC.

Leadership & Communication: Previous roles in client experience, sales, and content writing have equipped me with the essential soft skills for clear, concise defect reporting and cross-functional team collaboration.

I am driven to master test automation, security testing, and advanced debugging to ensure flawless product delivery. Let's connect and build something resilient! ⚽
